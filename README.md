# Zwift Play
As MyWhoosh does not support Zwift Click or Zwift Play for virtual shifting I decided to look for a solution to still be able to use those hardware buttons. The MyWhoosh touch buttons are way too small anyway.

The solution I found is adjusting the work from ajchellew to add an Accessibility Service functionality that simulates the touch press on the virtual shifting when the buttons on your Zwift Click / Play are clicked.

Instructions:
1. Install and open the app
2. Allow the accessibility service permission for the app and the others (connecting to the Zwift Bluetooth devices)
3. click a button on your Zwift Click
4. follow the progress in the app - you should be able to see it in the app if plus / minus are clicked
5. open MyWhoosh and enjoy
   
Please note that I only tested this on my phone. The simulated touches may be misplaced on other phones - let me know if it does.
